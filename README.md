# Challenge 2: WebdriverJS Axe Setup

## Personal Note:

Welcome to my Deque tech challenge! First and foremost: thank you for taking the time to review this and for your consideration for this role.

**If you run into any issues, or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.**

## Tech Stack

**Node.JS**

NPM Packages used:\
-`axe-core/webdriverjs`\
-`seleniuv-webdriver`\
-`mocha`\
-`chai`


## Functionality 

The **`test.js`** file tests the Demo Mars page for 3 cases:\
-`main-nav CSS selector is loaded`\
-`page title is correct`\
-`links redirect to the correct URL`

The **`scan.js`** file scans the Demo Mars page for accessibility. Results are returned to the console on the command line. Added extra variables to drill down into the JSON object easier. 

Happy testing!
